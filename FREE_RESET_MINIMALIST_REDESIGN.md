## CORE PHILOSOPHY

### Minimalist Approach
**"Less is more. Focus on what works. Track what matters."**

**Principles:**
1. **5 Core Rituals** - Not 9. Focus on essentials that create maximum impact
2. **Time Wealth Tracking** - Every ritual is tracked. Time invested = transformation
3. **Discipline Through Structure** - Simple, clear, non-negotiable
4. **Micro-Education** - 5-10 min daily reading, not overwhelming
5. **Vice Elimination** - Cut what holds you back, track what you eliminate
6. **Pattern-Specific** - Personalized but universal system

---

## THE 5 CORE RITUALS

### Based on Expert Consensus

**1. FASTING (Time Tracked)**
- **Duration:** 16-18 hours (flexible: start with 12, build to 18)
- **Time Tracking:** Track fasting window (start time, end time)
- **Why:** Autophagy, BDNF, metabolic flexibility, cellular repair
- **Expert:** Dr. Andrew Huberman, Dr. Peter Attia, Dr. Joe Dispenza

**2. HYDRATION + INTENTION (Time Tracked)**
- **Duration:** 1-2 min (morning ritual)
- **Time Tracking:** Track intention-setting time
- **Why:** Intention primes nervous system, hydration supports cognitive function
- **Expert:** Dr. Joe Dispenza, Dr. Andrew Huberman

**3. MOVEMENT (WALKING) + AFFIRMATION (Time Tracked)**
- **Duration:** 20 minutes minimum
- **Time Tracking:** Track walk time, track affirmation repetition
- **Why:** BDNF, neuroplasticity, neural pathway rewiring
- **Expert:** Dr. Andrew Huberman, Dr. Joe Dispenza, Mel Robbins

**4. FLOW ACTIVITY + CLASSICAL MUSIC (Time Tracked)**
- **Duration:** 25 minutes (Pomodoro) minimum, up to 2 hours

## THE 22-DAY VICE ELIMINATION CHALLENGE

### Based on Expert Consensus

**CORE VICES (Non-Negotiable):**
1. **Junk Food** - Track days without
2. **Sugar** - Track days without
3. **Alcohol** - Track days without

**OPTIONAL VICES (User Selects):**
4. **Screen Time** - Track hours reduced
5. **Smoking** - Track days without
6. **Porn** - Track days without

**Tracking System:**
- Daily check-in: "Did I eliminate [vice] today?" (Yes/No)
- Streak counter: "X days without [vice]"
- Progress visualization: Calendar view, streak badges

**Expert Rationale:**
- **Dr. Gabor Maté:** "Addictions are patterns. Eliminating them breaks the pattern."
- **Dr. Andrew Huberman:** "Sugar and alcohol disrupt neuroplasticity. Eliminating them accelerates pattern reset."
- **Dr. Joe Dispenza:** "Vices keep you in the past. Eliminating them creates space for new identity."

---

## DAILY STRUCTURE

### Minimalist Design

**Morning (5-10 min):**
1. **Fasting Check-In** - "Did I start my fast?" (Track start time)
2. **Hydration + Intention** - "I'm grateful for this water. My intention today is..." (1-2 min, tracked)
3. **Daily Prompt** - Pattern-specific prompt (5 min reading)

**Midday (20-30 min):**
4. **Movement + Affirmation** - 20 min walk with pattern-specific affirmation (tracked)
5. **Vice Check-In** - "Did I eliminate my vices today?" (Quick check)

**Evening (30-60 min):**
6. **Flow Activity + Classical Music** - 25 min minimum, purpose-driven work (tracked)
7. **Let It Out (Journaling)** - 5-10 min, pattern-specific prompts (tracked)
8. **Daily Micro-Education** - 5-10 min reading about pattern, life areas, transformation

**Total Time:** ~1-2 hours/day (but tracked, so you see time invested)

---

## TIME WEALTH TRACKING SYSTEM

### The Core of the System

**What Gets Tracked:**
1. **Fasting Time** - Hours fasted (16-18h target)
2. **Hydration + Intention Time** - Minutes spent (1-2 min)
3. **Movement Time** - Minutes walked (20 min minimum)
4. **Flow Activity Time** - Minutes in flow (25 min minimum)
5. **Journaling Time** - Minutes journaling (5-10 min)
6. **Vice Elimination** - Days without vices (streak counter)
7. **Total Time Invested** - Daily total, weekly total, 22-day total

**Visualization:**
- Daily dashboard: "Today I invested X hours in my reset"
- Weekly summary: "This week I invested X hours"
- 22-day total: "I invested X hours in breaking my pattern"

**Why Time Tracking Matters:**
- **Dr. James Clear:** "What gets measured gets managed. Tracking creates awareness."
- **Dr. Joe Dispenza:** "Time invested in new behaviors creates new neural pathways."
- **Mel Robbins:** "Tracking creates accountability. You can't improve what you don't measure."

- **Expert Quote:** *"The vagus nerve connects your brain to your body. Activating it creates safety and regulation."* - Dr. Bessel van der Kolk
